##Who?
My name is Anders Bech Mellson.
I am a developer, a father, a husband and a software student at the IT University of Copenhagen.

##Technologies
I am a big fan of

1. Scala
2. IntelliJ
3. Pebble
4. Android
5. iOS
6. Xbox
7. Digitizers
8. etc..

##Why?
I have put together this blog with the purpose of remembering.
All too often, as a developer, you have to go through a long and tedious setup before you can get crunching.
Whenever I run into one of these situations I will blog about them.
Helping myself when I later have to Google my own brain.
Hopefully you can use some of this information as well.
